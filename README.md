# Repeating Alarm Bug (fixed)

This project is a test to put in light a bug I have with the Android **AlarmManager**.

I might be using it incorrectly so, please, if you something wrong please ping me.

**Update:** The root cause was not in the way of implementing the Alarms... Samsung's aggressive battery optimisation is responsible. See the `Conclusion` to know how to fix it.

# Conclusion

**All types of alarms are well implemented. In fact, the problem only happens on Samsung devices (booooh!). In order to make them work more than 5 days, you'll have to disable the Battery Optimization on the app:**

* Go to "device maintenance"
* Click on "Battery"
* Scroll down to "Unmonitored apps"
* Click on the up right button, and click on "add"
* Add your app.

**After that, your alarms will be infinite, yay \o/**

# Description of the problem

## What I need
I need an alarm to be triggered repeatedly for the whole smartphone life. The alarm should show a notification.

(Note that device restarting is not handle in this test project, so I'm not rescheduling alarms after boot. This is not needed since the problem appears when the device is awake)

## What I don't get
The alarm triggers fine for 3 or 4 days. After that **nothing**. Even the notification is gone.

## How is the project organized

### General

The app is very simple.

`MainActivity` shows a button which is charge of triggering the repeating alarm. When the button is pushed, it asks to the `AlarmScheduler` to schedule an alarm (every minutes).

When the alarm is received, the BroadcastReceiver `AlarmReceiver` start the `AlarmService` Service.

The `AlarmService` post a notification with the name of the implementation. On the notification, the time can be seen to check when was the last notification.

### Branches

To test multiple Alarm implementations, I have one branch per implementation. Each implementation has a different package name to allow testing multiple implementations on the same device. Each implementation has also an implementation name which is printed in the notification.

#### Repeat elapsed (also on master)

This implementation uses [the (inexact) repeating alarm of the type `ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setInexactRepeating(int,%20long,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)).

It is available on the [repeat_elapsed](https://github.com/djavan-bertrand/RepeatingAlarmBug/tree/repeat_elapsed) branch.

#### Reschedule exact elapsed

This implementation uses [the exact alarm of the type `ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setExact(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)). It sets a new alarm each time the notification is displayed.

It is available on the [reschedule_exact_elapsed](https://github.com/djavan-bertrand/RepeatingAlarmBug/tree/reschedule_exact_elapsed) branch.

#### Reschedule inexact elapsed

This implementation uses [the inexact alarm of the type `ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#set(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)). It sets a new alarm each time the notification is displayed.

It is available on the [reschedule_inexact_elapsed](https://github.com/djavan-bertrand/RepeatingAlarmBug/tree/reschedule_inexact_elapsed) branch.

#### Reschedule exact and allow while idle elapsed

This implementation uses [the exact alarm of the type `ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP` which is allowed to be executed even when the system is in low-power idle modes](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager.html#setExact(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)). It sets a new alarm each time the notification is displayed.

It is available on the [reschedule_exact_idle_elapsed](https://github.com/djavan-bertrand/RepeatingAlarmBug/tree/reschedule_exact_idle_elapsed) branch.
